#### First Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

The **Restaurant Reviews** project is a mobile-ready web application. In **Restaurant Reviews Project Stage One**, the design is responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.There is also a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

1. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
2. Explore the provided code, to see the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
